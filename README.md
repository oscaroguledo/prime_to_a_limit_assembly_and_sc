# Generating an array of prime numbers up to a limit

This code efficiently identifies prime numbers within a specified numerical range (0 to a given limit). It combines x86_64 assembly language with a C wrapper. The assembly code comprises the primary functionality, employing optimizations to swiftly eliminate multiples of 2 and 3, along with a sophisticated trial division method using specific divisor patterns.

The getarray function initiates a loop through the specified range (0 to the limit) and calls is_prime to ascertain the primality of each number within that range. The is_prime function employs an optimized approach to determine prime numbers. It performs a core primality test within a loop (prime_loop) using various checks to bypass trivial cases efficiently.

This code forms the groundwork for identifying prime numbers within a designated numerical range (0 to the given limit). Leveraging low-level optimizations of assembly language, it ensures enhanced performance in identifying prime numbers efficiently.
